# hello-world
This is my first repository.
I'm in month 2 of Andrei Neagoie's "Learn to code in 2018, get hired, and have fun along the way (in 5 months)".
I recently quit my managerial day job, and I'm devoting all of my time to becoming a dev.  I discovered that I have an obsession with learning. My obsession went into overdrive when I dug deeper into Bitcoin.  The more I learned, the more I wanted to know.  I dove head-first into the rabbit hole with my mind wide open, and I've been unbelievably grateful ever since.
You can call me bc.
